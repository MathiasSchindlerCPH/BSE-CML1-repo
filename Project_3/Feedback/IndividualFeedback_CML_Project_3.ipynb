        "Feedback: Really good work. Some nice data visualisations and pre-processing were done. Dates were managed and standardisation was done. Good understanding of a variety of clustering algorithms was shown with different method to estimate the number of clusters. SVD was done and the number of latent features was well estimated. But the latent features themselves were not properly computed"
