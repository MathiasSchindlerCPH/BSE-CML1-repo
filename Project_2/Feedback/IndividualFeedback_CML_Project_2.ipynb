        "Feedback: Excellent work. Some simple exploratory analysis was done. Standardisation, dummies and polynomial transformations were done. Further PCA was used to reduce the dimension of the space (losing minimal information) for computational convenience. Good understanding of binary and multi-class logistic regression is shown, using cross-validation to tune complexity penalisation and methods to manage class imbalance."
